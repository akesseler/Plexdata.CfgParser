<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>
The <i>Plexdata CFG Parser</i> represents a library allowing reading and writing of old&#8209;fashioned 
CFG and INI files into structured configuration items. It is also possible to configure the behavior of 
how files are read or written.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore, a set of structured configuration items can be converted into user&#8209;defined classes. 
This makes it possible to directly read a configuration file into a class structure. Of course, writing 
a configuration file from a class structure is possible as well.
</p>
<p>
Different styles of configuration files are also supported. Already predefined are the Windows and Linux 
styles, but configuring user&#8209;defined styles is supported as well.
</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>
In the age of having configuration file formats like JSON or XML a configuration file format like INI 
seems to be pretty old&#8209;fashioned. And indeed it is. But from time to time it is useful to support a 
standard INI configuration file. And this library is intended for exactly these special use&#8209;cases.
</p>

<p>
As first let&rsquo;s have a glance at what exactly is meant when talking about INI files.
</p>

<p>
In fact, a standard INI file is nothing else but a collection of key&#8209;value&#8209;pairs. Additionally, 
these key&#8209;value&#8209;pairs can be grouped into sections. See example below for some details.
</p>

<pre><code>[general]
enable-show-pages: yes
enable-show-styles: no
default-language: english

[network]
server-address: 192.168.5.42
server-port: 45054</code></pre>

<p>

On the other hand, each of the systems uses a different format for such types of configuration files. 
For example, Windows INI files usually use the equal sign (=) to separate a label from its value. 
And vice versa, on Linux systems a colon (:) is used instead. 
This makes it almost impossible to load configuration files of both systems with the same software.
</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p>
Reading data from an external CFG file is pretty easy. The only thing to do is to call the <code>Read()</code> 
method from class <code>ConfigReader</code>. As result of this an instance of class <code>ConfigContent</code>
is returned. See below for an example.
</p>

<pre><code>String filename = @"C:\config.ini";
ConfigContent content = ConfigReader.Read(filename);</code></pre>

<p>
Did no exception occur then an access to each configuration section as well as to each value of 
a section is easily possible by using the array operator. Assuming the read configuration file 
contains a section named <code>general</code> and there in a value named <code>version</code>. 
Accessing this particular value can be done as shown in example right here below.
</p>

<pre><code>ConfigSection section = content["general"];
if (section != null)
{
    ConfigValue value = section["version"];
    if (value != null)
    {
        Version version = ValueConverter.Convert(value.Value, typeof(Version)) as Version;
        Trace.WriteLine($"The verion is {version}");
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>
Sometimes it might be useful to find errors and/or misplaced configuration details. For this 
purpose it is possible the provide an additional list of type <code>ConfigWarning</code>. This 
list is filled up during file parsing and contains items in case of issues could be determined.
How to determine configuration warnings is shown in example below.
</p>

<pre><code>String filename = @"C:\config.ini";
List&lt;ConfigWarning&gt; warnings = new List&lt;ConfigWarning&gt;();
ConfigContent content = ConfigReader.Read(filename, warnings);
foreach (ConfigWarning warning in warnings)
{
    Trace.WriteLine(warning);
}</code></pre>

<p>
Another aspect to be considered when processing a configuration file is the fact that users can 
create and/or modify a configuration file. And for sure, users are not perfect and they do mistakes. 
Such a mistake could be that lines are included which do not represent a value type.
</p>
<p>
Being able to find this kind of values, class <code>ConfigContent</code> provides a property named 
<code>Others</code>. How to use property <code>Others</code> is demonstrated below.
</p>

<pre><code>String filename = @"C:\config.ini";
ConfigContent content = ConfigReader.Read(filename);
ConfigOthers others = content.Others;
if (others.IsValid)
{
    for (Int32 index = 0; index &lt; others.Count; index++)
    {
        ConfigOther other = others[index];
        Trace.WriteLine(other.Value);
    }
}</code></pre>

<h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>

<p>
In contrast to reading a configuration file, writing it requires a bit more effort. And how to 
accomplish this task is part of this section.
</p>

<p>
First of all, an instance of class <code>ConfigContent</code> must be created and configured as 
well. See following example that shows how to prepare a configuration before it can be written.
</p>

<pre><code>ConfigContent content = new ConfigContent();
ConfigSection section = new ConfigSection("general", "The general section contains global values.");
ConfigValue value = new ConfigValue("enable-show-pages", "yes");
section.Append(value);
value = new ConfigValue("enable-show-styles", "no");
section.Append(value);
value = new ConfigValue("default-language", "english", "Using english, german and french is possible.");
section.Append(value);
content.Append(section);
section = new ConfigSection("network", "The network section contains network values.");
value = new ConfigValue("server-address", "192.168.5.42", "Using the host name is also possible.");
section.Append(value);
value = new ConfigValue("server-port", "45054");
section.Append(value);
content.Append(section);</code></pre>

<p>
Another way to initialize the configuration content is to use the array operators. How this can be done 
is shown here below.
</p>

<pre><code>ConfigContent content = new ConfigContent();
content["general"] = new ConfigSection();
content["general"].Comment = new ConfigComment("The general section contains global values.");
content["general"]["enable-show-pages"] = new ConfigValue();
content["general"]["enable-show-pages"].Value = "yes";
content["general"]["enable-show-styles"] = new ConfigValue();
content["general"]["enable-show-styles"].Value = "no";
content["general"]["default-language"] = new ConfigValue();
content["general"]["default-language"].Value = "english";
content["general"]["default-language"].Comment = new ConfigComment("Using english, german and french is possible.");
content["network"] = new ConfigSection();
content["network"].Comment = new ConfigComment("The network section contains network values.");
content["network"]["server-address"] = new ConfigValue();
content["network"]["server-address"].Value = "192.168.5.42";
content["network"]["server-address"].Comment = new ConfigComment("Using the host name is also possible.");
content["network"]["server-port"] = new ConfigValue();
content["network"]["server-port"].Value = "45054";</code></pre>

<p>
After a configuration has been initialized successfully, it can be written into a file. How to write such a 
configuration file is done as follows.
</p>

<pre><code>String filename = @"C:\config.ini";
ConfigWriter.Write(content, filename);</code></pre>

<p>
With the above configuration, the written result would like as shown below.
</p>

<pre><code>[general] # The general section contains global values.
enable-show-pages = yes
enable-show-styles = no
default-language = english # Using english, german and french is possible.

[network] # The network section contains network values.
server-address = 192.168.5.42 # Using the host name is also possible.
server-port = 45054</code></pre>

<p>
On the other hand, the <i>Plexdata CFG Parser</i> also supports a configuration file header. 
How to use this feature is explained right here.
</p>

<p>
As done for the content, the header of a configuration file must be configured as well. Here below 
please find the needed steps.
</p>

<pre><code>ConfigComment comment = new ConfigComment("header comment line 1");
content.Header.Append(comment);
comment = new ConfigComment("header comment line 2");
content.Header.Append(comment);</code></pre>

<p>
After writing the above configuration, the written result would like as shown below.
</p>

<pre><code># header comment line 1
# header comment line 2

[section-1] 
...</code></pre>

<p>
Related to the file header, two more details should be discussed. The first detail is t
he usage of placeholders and the second detail is the usage of the default header.
</p>

<p>
In conjunction with the configuration file header, it will be possible to include current 
file name and/or current file date. How to use these placeholders is demonstrated below.  
</p>

<pre><code>ConfigComment comment = new ConfigComment($"File name: \"{ConfigDefines.FileNamePlaceholder}\"");
content.Header.Append(comment);
comment = new ConfigComment($"File date: \"{ConfigDefines.FileDatePlaceholder}\"");
content.Header.Append(comment);</code></pre>

<p>
After writing the above configuration, the written result would like as shown below.
</p>

<pre><code># File name: "config.ini"
# File date: "2019-10-29 17:42:23"

[section-1] 
...</code></pre>

<p>
The feature of having a default header is born because of the need of providing users with the 
rules of how to use a configuration file. For this purpose class <code>ConfigSettings</code> 
provides a static method named <code>CreateDefaultHeader()</code>. How to use this feature is 
shown below.
</p>

<pre><code>ConfigContent content = new ConfigContent();
content.Header = ConfigSettings.CreateDefaultHeader("Auto-generated configuration file.", true);</code></pre>

<p>
After writing the above configuration, the written result would like as shown below.
</p>

<pre><code>﻿# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Auto-generated configuration file.
# File name: config.ini
# File date: 2019-10-27 04:31:02
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# Header rules:
# - Each header line must start with a comment marker.
# - Each of the header lines must be a pure comment line.
# - Each header comment line must be in front on any other content.
# Comment Rules:
# - Comments can be tagged by character '#' or by character ';'.
# - Comments can be placed in a single line but only as header type.
# - Comments can be placed at the end of line of each section.
# - Comments can be placed at the end of line of each value-data-pair.
# Section Rules:
# - Sections are enclosed in '[' and ']'.
# - Section names should not include white spaces.
# Value Rules:
# - Values can have an empty data part.
# - Value names should not include white spaces.
# - Values without a section are treated as 'others'.
# - Values are built as pair of 'name:data' or of 'name=data'.
# - Value data that use '#', ';', '[', ']', ':' or '=' must be enclosed by '"'.
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<h2 id="parsing">Parsing</h2>

<p>
Another feature of the <i>Plexdata CFG Parser</i> is the possibility to put the content 
of a read configuration file into a user&#8209;defined class structure. How to use this 
functionality is part of this section.
</p>

<p>
But before starting with an example some details should be discussed. The advantage of 
this feature is the guarantee of type&#8209;safeness. This is indeed pretty important 
because of otherwise each value must be converted manually. But on the other hand, the 
disadvantage is that an additional implementation is required.
</p>

<p>
As first it is necessary to implement its own class structure. The following code snippet 
shows an example of such a class structure. Furthermore, is shows how to configure these 
classes to be able to use the parsing feature.
</p>

<pre><code>public class GeneralSettings
{
    [ConfigValue("enable-show-pages", Default = "yes")]
    public Boolean EnableShowPages { get; set; }
    [ConfigValue("enable-show-styles", Default = "no")]
    public Boolean EnableShowStyles { get; set; }
    [ConfigValue("default-language", Comment = "Using english, german and french is possible.")]
    public String DefaultLanguage { get; set; }
    [ConfigIgnore]
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}

public class NetworkSettings
{
    [ConfigValue("server-address", Comment = "Usage of IPv4 or IPv6 is possible.")]
    public IPAddress ServerAddress { get; set; }
    [ConfigValue("server-port")]
    public UInt16 ServerPort { get; set; }
    [ConfigIgnore]
    public DateTime Timestamp { get; set; }
}

public class ProgramSettings
{
    [ConfigSection("general", Comment = "The general section contains global values.")]
    public GeneralSettings GeneralSettings { get; set; }
    [ConfigSection("network", Comment = "The network section contains network values.")]
    public NetworkSettings NetworkSettings { get; set; }
}</code></pre>

<p>
With these setting classes in background, reading and parsing a configuration file can be done 
like shown below.
</p>

<pre><code>String filename = @"C:\network.ini";
ConfigContent content = ConfigReader.Read(filename);
ProgramSettings settings = ConfigParser<ProgramSettings>.Parse(content);</code></pre>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>
Yet another feature of the <i>Plexdata CFG Parser</i> is the possibility to use a special 
configuration. Unfortunately, only three types are supported at the moment. These are the 
types for Unix&#8209;styled configuration files, for Windows&#8209;styled configuration files, 
as well as a mixture of Unix&#8209;and Windows&#8209;style.
</p>

<p>
Choosing a different configuration setting is pretty easy. The only thing to do is to apply a 
new setting instance to the <code>Settings</code> property of class <code>ConfigSettings</code>. 
Please see below for an example.
</p>

<pre><code>ConfigSettings.Settings = new ConfigSettingsUnix();</code></pre>

<p>
With the configuration used in section <a href="#writing">Writing</a> a written configuration 
file would look like shown below.
</p>

<pre><code>﻿[general] # The general section contains global values.
enable-show-pages: True
enable-show-styles: False
default-language: english # Using english, german and french is possible.

[network] # The network section contains network values.
server-address: 192.168.5.42 # Usage of IPv4 or IPv6 is possible.
server-port: 45054</code></pre>

<p>
In this context, two things should be noted. As first the configuration settings must be changed
before creating a new configuration content. Secondly, the configuration settings are only relevant 
during writing a configuration file.
</p>

<p>
More information about using the configuration settings as well as about all other details can be found inside 
the complete API documentation. This API documentation is available as CHM file and can be downloaded from the 
releases page on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/akesseler/Plexdata.CfgParser/releases">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2 id="limitation">Limitation</h2>

<p>
There are some limitations when using the <i>Plexdata CFG Parser</i>. Clarifying them is task 
of this section.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
Data parts of configuration values must <b>not</b> contain additional double quotes. For more 
information please refer to section <a href="#double-quotes">Inner Double Quotes</a>.
</li>
<li>
Leading and/or trailing section and/or value comments are not supported. Comments can only be 
placed behind sections and/or values.
</li>
<li>
Multi&#8209;line comments behind sections and/or values are not supported. Only single line comments 
are possible. For more information see section <a href="#multiline-comments">Multi&#8209;line Comments</a>.
</li>
<li>
Creating a configuration from scratch or reading an existing configuration file may cause trouble 
when writing it back to disk. Please see section <a href="#losing-content">Losing File Content</a> 
below for more information.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>

<h3 id="double-quotes">Inner Double Quotes</h3>

Inner double quotes like shown below are not supported at the moment.

<pre><code>value-label="Inner double quote characters (") are not supported"</code></pre>

Escaping them like <code>"inner \"value"</code> does unfortunately not work.

<h3 id="multiline-comments">Multi&#8209;line Comments</h3>

<p>
Multi&#8209;line comments like shown below won&rsquo;t work.
</p>

<pre><code>label-1=value-1 # comment line 1
                # comment line 2
                # comment line 3
label-2=value-2</code></pre>

<p>
Only single line comments, as shown as follows, are supported.
</p>

<pre><code>[section-1] # section comment...
label-1=value-1 # value 1 comment...
label-2=value-2 # value 2 comment...</code></pre>

<p>
Please keep in mind, single line comments are exclusively reserved for the header of a 
configuration file.
</p>

<h3 id="losing-content">Losing File Content</h3>
<p>
The complete content of an already existing file is disposed as soon as a configuration content 
is written back to this file. This means, it is impossible to selectively update only the data 
that have been changed.
</p>
