## Plexdata CFG Parser

The _Plexdata CFG Parser_ represents a library allowing reading and writing of old-fashioned CFG and INI files into structured configuration items. It is also possible to configure the behavior of how files are read or written.

Furthermore, a set of  structured configuration items can be converted into user-defined classes. This makes it possible to directly read a configuration file into a class structure. Of course, writing a configuration file from a class structure is possible as well.

Different styles of configuration files are also supported. Already predefined are the Windows and Linux styles, but configuring user-defined styles is supported as well.

The software has been published under the terms of _MIT License_.
